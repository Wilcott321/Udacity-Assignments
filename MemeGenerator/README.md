## Meme Generator
A project part of the Udacity Frontend Developer Program curriculum.

### About
This is a simple meme generator that allows users to upload a photo, create text for their meme, and save the file

### Specs
For this project, we used HTML5 Canvas, an api used to edit, resize, and change images as well as draw objects. The main functionality of the generator is written in JavaScript.
