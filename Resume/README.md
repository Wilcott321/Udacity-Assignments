## About
This is a JavaScript-powered, interactive resume suitable for web developers and other creatives. It includes sections for work experience, projects, education, online classes taken, a skills chart, and a map.

The skills chart is powered by Chart.js, a JavaScript library for creating charts and graphs using object data.

The map is powered by the Google Map API. You may read more information about how to use this API in the documents available [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/). An auth key may be required.
