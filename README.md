## About This Project Folder
I'm currently enrolled in the Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree program, as a receipient of the Transcend Award. With this award, we have 3 months to complete the entire Frontend curriculum.  This is no easy feat, as the normal Nanodegree student takes 6-9 months to complete curriculum. I'm excited about being honored with this Award and happy to join over 50 other students in this program.

To help me track my progress and play around with what I've learned, I created this project folder. I will only include code for **optional** tasks assigned, such as those offered for additional practice. The quizzes, problem set solutions, or any required projects that I submit for official review **will not** be added here.

## Contents
