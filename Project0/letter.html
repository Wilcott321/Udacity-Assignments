        <p>Hi E,</p>
        <p>Congrats on making it into Udacity as a receipient of the Transcend Award! This is a huge honor in which you will be able to complete a nanodegree on scholarship. While getting the award seemed simple, now you will have to put your basic knowledge and abilities to the test. You are faced with a challenge of completing a nanodegree in less than 3 months while also working full-time and volunteering as a mentor. Sticking to a study plan and schedule will probably be the hardest part for you.  In the past, you have not been good with time conformity.</p>
        <p>The orientation probably made you nervous.  You probably are still thinking about whether you will be able to complete all the projects on time. As the projects become more difficult, you may also want to quit, just so you can feel you have the time and space to just breathe without the pressure.  But while you are thinking about quitting, I want you to remember this note to yourself: <em>nothing ever worth having was obtained without hard work</em>. </p>
        <p>You've been through this before. You have taught yourself enough HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to the point  where people are willing to pay you to create great sites for them. Under pressure, you have delivered  time and time again.  Now is the time to achieve something for yourself. This nanodegree doesn't just represent another credential to add to your resume. It represents your effort, skills, and resilience to fulfilling a dream you defined for yourself back in 2015: to solidify your role as a web developer. </p>
        <p>You will get tired. You will want skim through lessons and half-ass through projects, but don't. You owe it to yourself to give your best effort even under an incredible amount of stress. This will require discipline, but it's the same discipline that will be expected of you when you obtain your first job role as a frontend developer. Therefore you should do the following when self-doubt and the urge to quit creeps in:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Step back and breathe</li>
            <li>Go through the lecture videos one more time</li>
            <li>Review your notes</li>
            <li>Utilize Google and Stack Overflow</li>
            <li>Don't be afraid to ask questions</li>
            <li>Seek support before it's too late</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You should also keep note of the following study tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep your workspace organized</li>
            <li>Guard your schedule, time yourself if need be</li>
            <lI>Review the grading rubric to stay on task</li>
            <li>Don't multi-task, stay focused on your study plan</li>
            <li>Your gym time <i>is</i>your free time</li>
            <li>Get some sleep</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I know you can do it, because I'm you and you're awesome!</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Best,<br/>
